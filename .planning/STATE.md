# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Svelte 5 only, runes-based reactivity
- Init: Headless/unstyled, data attributes for CSS targeting
- Init: shadcn-svelte registry + npm dual distribution
- [Phase 01-project-setup]: Use @eslint/js@10.0.1 (10.1.0 does not exist on npm — research version was wrong)
- [Phase 01-project-setup]: PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=.playwright set in test scripts — system cache dir had EPERM
- [Phase 01-project-setup]: Placeholder WheelPicker.svelte + +page.svelte created in Plan 01 (required for svelte-kit sync)
- [Phase 01-project-setup]: Removed invalid 'hot' option from vitest.config.ts — not valid in @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte v7
- [Phase 01-project-setup]: Added .claude/ and .playwright/ to ESLint ignores to prevent linting GSD tooling and Playwright browser binaries
- [Phase 01-project-setup]: Browser tests blocked by sandbox environment (Playwright session timeout) — documented as known limitation, not a code defect

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Behavior when parent updates `value` while inertia animation is mid-flight is unspecified — decision needed at planning time (cancel and jump, or let animation complete then reconcile)
- Phase 3: `visibleCount` must-be-multiple-of-4 constraint from React source needs validation — may be relaxable
- Phase 5: Confirm SSR safety — component must not execute browser APIs at module evaluation time
- Phase 6: shadcn registry `registryDependencies` between `WheelPicker` and `WheelPickerWrapper` must be declared correctly or CLI add fails silently
